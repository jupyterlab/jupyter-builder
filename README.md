# jupyter-builder

Build tools for JupyterLab (and remixes)

> This _will_ start as an extraction of the builder tools currently included in
> the core [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab).

## Why extracting the build tools?

- This would also solve some chicken-and-egg problems like jupyterlab/jupyterlab_pygments#23.
